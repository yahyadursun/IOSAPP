## UI Design
The UI for this app was mocked up in Figma to create a wireframe to build from. Icons were taken from free graphic design resources. The Trends screen was built using Apple's CareKitUI library invoking OCKCartesianChartView classes. Since this is a demo app and relatively small, the screens were built using the storyboard and custom XIB files and then tested on multiple device screens.
